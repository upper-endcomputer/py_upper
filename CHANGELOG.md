# v0.16.10

### Problem
- macOS packaging could still fail while copying an ordinary read-only PBS runtime file, with `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` from `os.chmod()`.

### Root cause
- The v0.16.9 custom copier stopped `copytree()`/`copy2()` metadata replay but still applied the full source POSIX mode to every copied file. A source mode such as `0444` caused the build to attempt a restrictive `chmod()` on the new file, which can be rejected by macOS in the app-bundle destination.

### Changes
- Make package-tree copies content-only; do not replay source POSIX modes or other filesystem metadata.
- Preserve executable status only for the launcher through an explicit platform packaging step.
- Keep runtime/native library copying independent of source executable/read-only modes.
- Add regressions for read-only runtime files, symlinks, and launcher executable mode.
- Bump the project version to 0.16.10.

### Verification
- Full local regression suite passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

# v0.16.9

### Problem
- macOS packaging could fail while copying the PBS runtime into `Contents/Resources/runtime` with `shutil.Error` / `Errno 1: Operation not permitted`.
- The failure affected ordinary Python runtime files and vendored packages, including `pip/_vendor/urllib3`, even though the source files were readable.

### Root cause
- `shutil.copytree()` uses metadata-preserving file copies by default and also applies directory metadata. On macOS, reproducing source filesystem flags/metadata can be rejected with `EPERM` inside the destination app bundle.

### Changes
- Replace package-time `shutil.copytree()` calls with a controlled recursive copier.
- Copy file contents and POSIX mode only; do not clone ACLs, extended attributes, timestamps, or filesystem flags.
- Preserve symlink targets so runtime and package links continue to work.
- Use the safe copier for the bundled runtime, compiled site-packages, app resources, and launcher.
- Add a regression test that simulates `copystat()` returning `EPERM`.
- Bump the project version to 0.16.9.

### Verification
- 21 local tests passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.

# v0.16.8

### Problem
- Every build from a development Python without Cython could trigger a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'` under VS Code/debugpy before the bootstrap logic recovered.
- The v0.16.7 bootstrap path also used an unconditional `pip --upgrade`, which could reinstall Cython on every build instead of reusing the project cache.

### Root cause
- The Cython availability probe executed `import Cython` in a child Python process. A debugger can pause on that expected exception even though the parent process captures the non-zero exit status.
- Cache probing did not distinguish an already-populated supported Cython cache from a missing dependency before invoking pip.

### Changes
- Probe the installed Cython distribution through `importlib.metadata` without importing the `Cython` package.
- Reuse a py_upper-owned Cython cache when a supported 3.1.x distribution is already present.
- Remove the unconditional pip `--upgrade` flag from the bootstrap path.
- Keep the developer Python environment untouched.
- Add regression coverage for cache reuse and non-reinstall behavior.

### Verification
- 20 local tests passed.
- `py_upper doctor` passed for linux-x86_64.
- `git diff --check` passed.

# v0.16.7

### Problem
- The packaged macOS application still copied application `.py` sources into `Contents/Resources/site-packages` for modules outside the narrow Cython include list, while `main.py` remained a Python entry module. Generated `.c` files could also pollute `app/src`.

### Root cause
- The source selector explicitly skipped `main.py` and only selected `core.*`, `services.*`, and `models.*`; `utils` was therefore copied as source. The staging step copied the entire source tree before removing only selected modules.

### Changes
- Compile every application `.py` module by default, including `main.py` and `utils.paths`; only package `__init__.py` markers remain as Python files.
- Remove the default Cython exclusion list.
- Generate C files under `build/cython` instead of writing them into `app/src`.
- Exclude `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `.pyo`, and generated C/C++ files from staging.
- Add regression tests for module selection, clean C generation, and source removal.

### Verification
- Local regression suite passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.

# v0.16.6

- Fixed Mach-O byte-order detection for macOS native dependency inspection. The previous parser reversed the arm64 CPU type and reported `0x0c000001`, rejecting valid Apple Silicon dylibs such as `libtcl9.0.dylib`. Universal Mach-O binaries are now checked for the requested architecture instead of being accepted unconditionally.

## 0.16.5

### Fixed

- Fix fresh development environments failing at the Cython step with `No module named cython`.
- Automatically bootstrap the supported Cython 3.1.x build dependency into a py_upper-owned cache instead of requiring a manual install into the developer Python.
- Keep the Cython cache isolated from the user's selected development environment and reuse it on subsequent builds.

### Verification

- 15 local tests passed.
- Cython bootstrap regression test covers the missing-dependency path.
- The v0.16.4 macOS relative-path/`--force` Cython fix remains covered by regression tests.

## 0.16.4

### Fixed

- Fix Cython source translation failing on macOS when an absolute source/output path did not materialize the requested `.c` file.
- Run Cython from the source directory with relative paths and `--force`, then validate the generated artifact with actionable diagnostics.

### Verification

- Local regression tests pass.
- `git diff --check` passes.

## v0.16.3

### Problem
- The v0.16.2 PBS runtime resolver called `user_agent()` without importing it, so a normal PBS-backed build failed with `NameError` before downloading the runtime.

### Changes
- Import `user_agent` explicitly in `tools/py_upper/runtime.py`.
- Add a regression test covering the runtime module's User-Agent dependency.
- Keep the v0.16.2 Python 3.8+ compatibility changes unchanged.

### Verification
- 12 tests passed locally.
- `python tools/build.py --doctor --target linux-x86_64` passed.

# py_upper Changelog

## 0.16.2 — Build Tool Python 3.8+ compatibility

### Problem
- Python 3.10 could not start `tools/build.py` because the build tool imported `tomllib`, which was added to the Python standard library in 3.11.
- Build-tool type annotations needed to remain importable on Python 3.8.
- The boundary between the Build Tool Python and the bundled Target Python needed to be explicit for legacy-runtime work.

### Changes
- Add `tools/py_upper/compat.py` with a vendored Tomli fallback for Python 3.8–3.10.
- Keep Python 3.11+ on standard-library `tomllib`.
- Normalize build-tool modules around postponed annotations.
- Declare Python 3.8 as the minimum Build Tool Python and provide a clear diagnostic below it.
- Add compatibility tests and documentation.
- Keep Target Runtime selection independent from Build Tool Python.

### Verification
- Python 3.13: 12 tests passed.
- TOML fallback path exercised by simulating an unavailable `tomllib`.
- `tools/build.py --doctor --target linux-x86_64` passed locally.
- Python 3.10 is included in the CI compatibility matrix for direct validation.
